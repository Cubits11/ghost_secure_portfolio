# 🕯️ GHOST SECURE – A Poetic Memory Vault for Grief, Integrity & Cybersecurity

## ❖ What is Ghost Secure?

**Ghost Secure** is a secure, AI-assisted emotional journaling system designed to protect what cannot be replaced: *your emotional truth*.  
It began as a grief ritual.  
It evolved into a cybersecurity portfolio.

Built by [Pranav Bhave](https://github.com/Cubits11), Ghost Secure is both a technical artifact and a philosophical weapon—fusing **encryption**, **tamper detection**, and **emotional AI** to create a journal that doesn't just store entries, but **remembers**.

## ❖ Why It Exists

> _"Not every log file is a heartbeat. But some are."_

Most journaling apps are built for productivity.  
**Ghost Secure** was built for death, dreams, and digital forensics.

This system is part of a larger architecture of **ethical emotional systems**.  
In a world where privacy is optional and memory is cheap, Ghost Secure chooses **sanctity over scale**.
